## How I Won My First 3 Hackathons as a Beginner

I'm 17 years old and currently studying for my A-levels in college (sixth form, the last two years of high school in most countries). Participating in hackathons wasn't originally part of my goals this year, but I decided to give it a shot—and surprisingly, I won all three hackathons I entered!

Hackathons are a great opportunity to showcase your skills and build innovative projects. Here's how I approached them and the key lessons I learned.

### The Winning Formula

During my first online hackathon at [Nosu](https://nosu.io), I reached out to a group of people to form a team. A 33x hackathon winner, [Bill Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-zhang1/), gave me this advice:

> To win a hackathon, you need three things: an impressive use case, an impressive demo, and a compelling pitch.

These three factors became my guiding principles throughout each hackathon.

## Tools That Helped Me Win

### 1. Demo Videos: Show, Don’t Just Tell
A GitHub README rarely stands out, but a well-made demo video does! Judges have to review tons of projects, and a compelling video serves as a powerful visual reminder of your work.

**Tools for Demo Videos:**
- **[Screen Studio](https://screen.studio/)** (Mac only) – High-quality, easy-to-edit screen recordings.
- **[CanVid](https://www.canvid.com/)** (Windows users) – A solid alternative for recording and editing demos.

### 2. AI-Powered Coding Assistance
At hackathons, we don’t have endless hours to perfect code. AI-assisted tools save time and help us focus on solving real problems.

**[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)** is an AI-powered coding assistant that reads your codebase, suggests real-time solutions to errors, and even generates code. Super efficient!

### 3. Rapid UI Development with Component Libraries
Beautiful UI matters, and **component libraries** help you build stunning frontends quickly.

- **[ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** – The best choice, seamlessly integrates with Vercel, built with Tailwind CSS.
- **[Magic UI](https://magicui.dev/)** – Provides pre-built animations and effects.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** – Essential for customizing and styling components quickly.

### 4. Instant Authentication with Clerk
[Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) makes user authentication effortless, so you don’t have to spend hours configuring auth or dealing with API headaches.

### 5. AI Integrations to Enhance Your Project
Adding AI features to your project can make it stand out. Some great APIs to explore:
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)** – Integrate AI-powered chat, summarization, and more.
- **[Anthropic AI](https://www.anthropic.com/)** – AI models for various applications.

### 6. Idea Generation with Nosu
Stuck on an idea? **[Nosu](https://nosu.io)** has a tool that generates hackathon project ideas based on your tech stack, hackathon theme, and track description. It pulls insights from past winning projects to give you a competitive edge.

## Final Thoughts
Winning three hackathons as a beginner was an incredible experience. The key takeaways? Build something innovative, create a compelling demo, and use the right tools to maximize efficiency. If you're thinking about joining a hackathon—go for it! You never know what you might achieve.
